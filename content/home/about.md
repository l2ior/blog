# Biography

Wen-Sheng (Vincent) Chu is a Research Scientist at <a href="https://ai.google/" target="_blank">Google AI</a>, dedicated to developing machine learning techniques for computer vision problems and products on mobile devices.

Prior to Google, he was a Deep Learning Scientist at Apple, taking a major role of algorithm development for on-device technology, including <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-xs/face-id/?afid=p238%7CsRWSYsWNs-dc_mtid_20925d2q39172_pcrid_305083746947&cid=wwa-us-kwgo-iphone-slid--" target="_blank">Face ID</a> shipped with iPhone X, real-time camera features shipped with descendent devices (eg, XR, XS, XS Max) and next-gen products.  Before Apple, he was a research staff in the <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University on Aug. 2010--2013, and received his Ph.D. from the same institute on Jan. 2017.

He has (co-)authored over 20 publications in leading journals and conferences in computer vision and machine learning.  He also led the early development of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/intraface-software-facial-image-analysis-now-ios-fernando-de-la-torre" target="_blank">IntraFace</a>, an automated face analysis software that won the Best Demo Award in IEEE Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (AFGR) 2015.  A spinoff of IntraFace, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/16/facial-gesture-controls/" target="_blank">FacioMetrics</a>, was later acquired by Facebook on Nov. 2016.  He also serves as an Area Chair on AFGR 2018--2019.
