abstract = "Event discovery aims to discover a temporal segment of interest, such as human behavior, actions or activities. Most approaches to event discovery within or between time series use supervised learning. This becomes problematic when some relevant event labels are unknown, are difficult to detect, or not all possible combinations of events have been anticipated. To overcome these problems, this paper explores Common Event Discovery (CED), a new problem that aims to discover common events of variable-length segments in an unsupervised manner. We propose an efficient branch-and-bound (B&B) framework that avoids exhaustive search while guaranteeing a globally optimal solution. The B&B framework takes as input any multidimensional signal that can be quantified into histograms. The effectiveness of the B&B framework is evaluated in motion capture of deliberate behavior and in video of spontaneous facial behavior in diverse interpersonal contexts: interviews, small groups of young adults, and parent-infant faceto-face interaction."
