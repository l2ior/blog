abstract = "We introduce a new cosegmentation approach, MOMI-cosegmentation, to segment multiple objects that repeatedly appear among multiple images. The proposed approach tackles a more general problem than conventional cosegmentation methods. The key idea of MOMI-cosegmentation is to incorporate a common pattern discovery algorithm with the proposed Gibbs energy model in a Markov random field framework. Our approach builds upon an observation that the detected common patterns provide useful information for estimating foreground statistics, while background statistics can be estimated from the remaining pixels. The initialization and segmentation processes of MOMI-cosegmentation are completely automatic, while the segmentation errors can be substantially reduced at the same time. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art."
