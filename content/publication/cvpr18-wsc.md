abstract = "We present a scalable weakly supervised clustering approach to learn facial action units (AUs) from large, freely available web images. Unlike most existing methods (*eg*, CNNs) that rely on fully annotated data, our method exploits web images with inaccurate annotations. We develop a weakly-supervised spectral algorithm that learns an embedding space to couple image appearance and semantics. The algorithm has efficient gradient update, and scales up to large quantities of images with a stochastic extension.  With the learned embedding space, we adopt rank-order clustering to identify groups of visually and semantically similar images, and re-annotate these groups for training AU classifiers."
